# TubeMQ configuration item description

The TubeMQ server includes two modules for the Master and the Broker. The Master also includes a Web front-end module for external page access (this part is stored in the resources). Considering the actual deployment, two modules are often deployed in the same machine, TubeMQ. The contents of the three parts of the two modules are packaged and delivered to the operation and maintenance; the client does not include the lib package of the server part and is delivered to the user separately.

Master and Broker use the ini configuration file format, and the relevant configuration files are placed in the master.ini and broker.ini files in the tubemq-server-3.8.0/conf/ directory.

Their configuration is defined by a set of configuration units. The Master configuration consists of four mandatory units: [master], [zookeeper], [bdbStore], and optional [tlsSetting]. The Broker configuration is mandatory. Broker], [zookeeper] and optional [tlsSetting] consist of a total of 3 configuration units; in actual use, you can also combine the contents of the two configuration files into one ini file.

In addition to the back-end system configuration file, the Master also stores the Web front-end page module in the resources. The root directory velocity.properties file of the resources is the Web front-end page configuration file of the Master.
